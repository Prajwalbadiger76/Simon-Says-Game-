A fun and interactive memory game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to test and challenge your memory skills! 

## 📖 How It Works

The game begins when the user presses any key on the keyboard. A random color from a set of four flashes on the screen, and the user must:
1. Observe and click the flashed color.
2. Progress through levels by remembering and entering the sequence of colors from the start of the game.

### Gameplay Example:
- **Level 1:** The yellow box flashes → Click on the yellow box.
- **Level 2:** The blue box flashes → Click on the yellow box (from level 1) and then the blue box.
